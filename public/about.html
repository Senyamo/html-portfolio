<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Im a self taught web developer have been in this journey of development since 2024 
  it has been something facinating as I had always wondered what goes into this web pages we 
  go into wanted to find out what is in the backround , so far it has been challenging but enjoyable

  of which developers can get on my GITHUB link is https://github.com/Senyamo

  learning and that ensures I get to also practise more what I have realised is web development need one to 
  always practice hoping for the best in this journey.
